Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with extensive experience in building web and mobile applications. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks. My primary languages include JavaScript, Python, and Java, but I also dabble in TypeScript, Rust, and C#.

I have a strong foundation in front-end technologies, including React and Angular, as well as back-end development using Node.js and Django. My expertise extends to working with databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL, which allows me to create robust and efficient data-driven applications.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and follow best practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Collaboration is key, and I enjoy working in agile teams where I can leverage version control systems like Git to streamline our workflow.

When I am not coding, I love exploring new technologies and frameworks. I am particularly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am actively experimenting with various libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I also have a keen interest in open-source contributions, and you can find my projects listed below.

Here are some of my pinned repositories:
- [Project One](https://github.com/terrisilva327/project-one): A web application for managing tasks, built with React and Node.js.
- [Project Two](https://github.com/terrisilva327/project-two): An e-commerce platform utilizing Django and PostgreSQL.
- [Project Three](https://github.com/terrisilva327/project-three): A mobile app developed with Flutter for tracking personal finances.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech!
